A sub theme for project Thunder drupal 8.

This is an open project for anyone to join. The purpose of it is too expore the setting u and use of a drupal 8 sub theme.

The Thunder project is a requirement as we will be using the thunder_base and thunder_admin themes. So install Drupal Thunder and then enable this sub theme.

# Sass compiling
A decided to use npm scripts for this process as i want to keep the dev area as simple as possible. Of course you could use grunt, gulp, broccoli and/or fez if you prefer a javascript task runner.

# JS linting
Any suggestions would be appreciated.

# Further development
More comments here to come.
